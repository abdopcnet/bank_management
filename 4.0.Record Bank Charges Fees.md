# Record Bank Charges/Fees

## In Bank Transaction

**Path**: `Accounting → Bank Transaction → [Open Transaction]`

**Section**: "Extended Bank Statement"

**Fields**:

-   `included_fee`: Fees included in amount
-   `excluded_fee`: Separate fees (auto-converts to `included_fee` on save)

**Automatic Conversion**:

-   On save: `excluded_fee` → `included_fee`
-   If `deposit > 0`: `deposit` = `deposit - excluded_fee`
-   If `withdrawal >= 0`: `withdrawal` = `withdrawal + excluded_fee`

**Rule**: `included_fee` cannot be greater than `withdrawal`
